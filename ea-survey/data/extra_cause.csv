"Development of the political System, even if there is democracy in the Western countries, many people don't trust in the System and Thing it's not perfekt, in my opinion it's the task of the intelligent people in a nation to discuss if there is a possibility to improve the structures and Show the people alternatives to the current System. For Example the fact that in an election you have to choose between parties and their opinion in all politics, maybe they choose a Party to improve their on Situation (less taxes etc.) but they have a total different opinion in foreign policy, maybe the System could be better with more elections in Differential topics or you can choose a Party for a Single Part of politics, only Examples, but i Think the effective altruism could help to improve the political System and spread ideas how IT can be done and that this is an Important step to improve the World and improve other issues like Protection of Environment and animals"
