"Eat meat
 but try to reduce the amount I eat"
 especially as my personal income has doubled over the past year and I hope it will continue to grow. I intend to work more hours and give a larger proportion away. I am quite a selfish person and conflicted between my own desires and giving to others. I found joy in being able to give in the early months of this year
