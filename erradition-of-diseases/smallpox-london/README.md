This graph is originally published by F. Fenner, D. A. Henderson, I. Arita, Z. Jezek, I. D. Ladnyi (1988) â€“ Smallpox and its Eradication. World Health Organization (WHO) 1988. Online here at the WHO website - http://whqlibdoc.who.int/smallpox/9241561106.pdf. The original graph can be found in Chapter 5. The history of smallpox and its spread around the world.

I've read the values form the original graph, to recreate it in an interactive form.

The source notes that the original data are from Guy (1882) and the Registrar General's Statistical Review of England and Wales.
